TFstream is the leading web-based application for integrating the athletic timing results of most timing systems (ALGE Timing - LYNX - LIF files - EVT files) into easy-to-use graphics. The 1.0.0 version used OBS-websocket to display various graphics and supported track competitions (timed results) and throwing and jumping competitions (extension measurements) but not yet support vertical jumps (high jump and pole vault). With the new 2.0.0 version currently under development the graphics became a single web page and supports track, vertical and horizontal results.
