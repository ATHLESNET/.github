TFstream is the leading web-based application for integrating the athletic timing results of most timing systems (ALGE Timing - LYNX - LIF files - EVT files) into easy-to-use graphics. Use OBS-websocket to display various graphics. It currently supports track competitions (timed results) and throwing and jumping competitions (extension measurements). Does not yet support vertical jumps (high jump and pole vault).

TFracewalk is the web application dedicated to the communication of warning data (suspension and release) in walking races. It does not include the integration of chronometric data and is currently deprecated as it does not currently have a central role compared to other apps.
